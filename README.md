# The_Final_Project
The Final Project is a Flash game I made for a game programming course in 2013. I was free to make whatever type of game I wanted, so I made a few small mini games that told a story.

Unfortunately, Flash has gone the way of the Dodo. But there are ways to play Flash files. I have added the .swf file to the project [here](https://github.com/davidklatch/The_Final_Project/tree/master/swf) and Opera version [48](https://ftp.opera.com/pub/opera/desktop/48.0.2685.52/) plays swf files. You can just drag and drop it into the browser.
